'''Please write a program which asks for two integer numbers. The program should then print out whichever is greater. If the numbers are equal, the program should print a different message.

Some examples of expected behaviour:

Sample output
Please type in the first number: 5
Please type in another number: 3
The greater number was: 5

Sample output
Please type in the first number:: 5
Please type in another number: 8
The greater number was: 8

Sample output
Please type in the first number: 5
Please type in another number: 5
The numbers are equal!
